We have reviewed the current IT setup of Niko Electrics and have developed the following recommendations for moving to a cloud-based infrastructure. We believe that a hybrid cloud model, combining on-premises and public cloud services, would be the most appropriate approach for Niko Electrics.
Background:
Niko Electrics is a small business that the provides the latest electronics and Gadgets. The company currently has 200 employees and 10 on-premises servers running Online Data Storage and Backup and Recovery.
Current IT Setup:

 The servers are managed by in-house IT team and are used for file storage, email, and customer management.
Recommendations:
1.	Contrast of cloud vs non-cloud solutions for each aspect of the infrastructure:
•	For file storage, a cloud-based solution such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive would offer increased accessibility and flexibility, as well as automatic backups and version control.
•	For email, a cloud-based solution such as Microsoft Office 365 or Google G Suite would provide access to email from any device with an internet connection, as well as additional features such as calendar and document collaboration.
•	For customer management, a cloud-based solution such as Salesforce would provide access to customer information from any location, as well as features such as lead generation and sales tracking.
2.	Recommendation: Based on the above analysis, we recommend a hybrid cloud model for Niko Electrics, with some applications and data hosted on-premises and others hosted by a public cloud provider. This approach would provide the benefits of the cloud, such as increased accessibility and scalability, while still allowing the company to maintain control over sensitive data and systems.
3.	Justification: A hybrid cloud model is the most appropriate approach for Niko Electrics because it allows the company to take advantage of the benefits of the cloud without sacrificing control over its data and applications. This approach would provide increased flexibility and scalability, as well as improved access to data and applications from any location. Additionally, a hybrid cloud model would allow the company to gradually migrate to the cloud at its own pace, reducing the risk and disruption associated with a complete transition to the cloud.
